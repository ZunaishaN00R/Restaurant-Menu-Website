- **CSS Code**: The styling for the webpage is defined in the `biet-f21-049.css` file. It includes styling for the navigation bar, hero section, featured menu items, and gallery images. The layout is designed to be responsive and visually appealing, with rounded borders, appropriate margins, padding, font sizes, and colors.
